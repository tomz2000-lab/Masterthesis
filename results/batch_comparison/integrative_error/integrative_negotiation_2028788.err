Round 3/5 (Proposal Phase) | Role: ROLE A

GOAL: Reach agreement that maximizes your utility
Your BATNA (Best Alternative): 26.2 points
You have 2 proposals remaining.

YOUR OPTIONS:
- **Server Room Size:** 50 sqm (10 pts), 100 sqm (30 pts), or 150 sqm (60 pts)
- **Meeting Room Access:** 2 days/week (10 pts), 4 days/week (30 pts), or 7 days/week (60 pts)
- **Cleaning Responsibility:** "IT" (10 pts), "Shared" (30 pts), or "Outsourced" (60 pts)
- **Branding Visibility:** "Minimal" (10 pts), "Moderate" (30 pts), or "Prominent" (60 pts)

YOUR PRIORITIES:
('Server Room Size (40% weight): Prefer 150 sqm of room size', 'Cleaning Responsibility (30% weight): Prefer shared arrangements', 'Branding Visibility (20% weight): Moderate visibility acceptable', 'Meeting Room Access (10% weight): 2 days access sufficient', 'Note: Server room size and cleaning are top priorities')

- Your last proposal: server_room: 150, meeting_access: 2, cleaning: Shared, branding: Minimal
- Opponent's last proposal: server_room: 150, meeting_access: 4, cleaning: IT, branding: Prominent
💡 ANALYSIS: The opponent's proposal gives you 42.0 points, which is ABOVE your BATNA (26.2), but you have 2 proposals left. You might negotiate for an even better deal.

Round 2/5 (Proposal Phase) | Role: ROLE B

GOAL: Reach agreement that maximizes your utility
Your BATNA (Best Alternative): 18.7 points
You have 3 proposals remaining.

YOUR OPTIONS:
- **Server Room Size:** 50 sqm (10 pts), 100 sqm (30 pts), or 150 sqm (60 pts)
- **Meeting Room Access:** 2 days/week (10 pts), 4 days/week (30 pts), or 7 days/week (60 pts)
- **Cleaning Responsibility:** "IT" (10 pts), "Shared" (30 pts), or "Outsourced" (60 pts)
- **Branding Visibility:** "Minimal" (10 pts), "Moderate" (30 pts), or "Prominent" (60 pts)

YOUR PRIORITIES:
('Meeting Room Access (40% weight): Prefer 7 days access to meeting room', 'Branding Visibility (30% weight): Prefer Prominent branding', 'Cleaning Responsibility (20% weight): Prefer IT to handle cleaning', 'Server Room Size (10% weight): 50 sqm are sufficient', 'Note: Meeting access and branding are top priorities')

CURRENT SITUATION:
- Your last proposal: server_room: 50, meeting_access: 2, cleaning: Shared, branding: Minimal
- Opponent's last proposal: server_room: 150, meeting_access: 2, cleaning: Shared, branding: Minimal
💡 ANALYSIS: The opponent's proposal gives you 19.0 points, which is ABOVE your BATNA (18.7), but you have 3 proposals left. You might negotiate for an even better deal.

Round 4/5 (Proposal Phase) | Role: ROLE A

GOAL: Reach agreement that maximizes your utility
Your BATNA (Best Alternative): 25.8 points
You have 1 proposals remaining.

YOUR OPTIONS:
- **Server Room Size:** 50 sqm (10 pts), 100 sqm (30 pts), or 150 sqm (60 pts)
- **Meeting Room Access:** 2 days/week (10 pts), 4 days/week (30 pts), or 7 days/week (60 pts)
- **Cleaning Responsibility:** "IT" (10 pts), "Shared" (30 pts), or "Outsourced" (60 pts)
- **Branding Visibility:** "Minimal" (10 pts), "Moderate" (30 pts), or "Prominent" (60 pts)

YOUR PRIORITIES:
('Server Room Size (40% weight): Prefer 150 sqm of room size', 'Cleaning Responsibility (30% weight): Prefer shared arrangements', 'Branding Visibility (20% weight): Moderate visibility acceptable', 'Meeting Room Access (10% weight): 2 days access sufficient', 'Note: Server room size and cleaning are top priorities')

CURRENT SITUATION:
- Your last proposal: server_room: 100, meeting_access: 4, cleaning: Shared, branding: Moderate
- Opponent's last proposal: server_room: 150, meeting_access: 2, cleaning: Shared, branding: Minimal
💡 ANALYSIS: The opponent's proposal gives you 36.0 points, which is ABOVE your BATNA (25.8), but you have 2 proposals left. You might negotiate for an even better deal.
